# [Honewdew Valley](https://kliu33.github.io/SDV/)

Welcome to Honeydew Valley, a JavaScript-based project inspired by the popular game Stardew Valley. In this game, players take on the role of a farmer, tending to crops, fishing, and decorating your own personal space.

Our game features a wide range of crops and fish to catch. Players can also upgrade their farm, purchase new equipment, and unlock decorations as they progress through the game.

We've put a lot of effort into making this game fun and accessible for players of all skill levels. Whether you're an experienced gamer or a casual player looking for a relaxing way to unwind, we think you'll find plenty to enjoy in Honeydew Valley.

## Functionality & MVPs:

Honeydew Valley features a side bar for audio, instructions, and general tips aswell as a canvas to render the game. 

When a user first loads into the game:

The user is spawned into a bare map, with nothing but some initial money. The game intentially does not feature a tutorial, a lot of the fun of the game is exploring and experimenting in order to decide how you want to play. There is no "correct" way to play the game, just like there is no "wrong" way to play the game (as long as you remember to eat). Just click the unmute button for some relaxing lofi and enjoy.

## Techonologies, Libraries, APIS

   This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
    -Canvas API to render the game
    -Webpack to bundle and transpile the source Javascript code
    -npm to manage project dependencies

## Implementation Timeline

   Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Get the basic functionality completely down, gather all the nessessary resources. Think about the different plants and fish that will need images. Refactor the code to create multiple JS files instead of everything in a single file.

   Monday: Work on the game flow, how the plants will grow, how fish will be caught, and how the interactions will work between the user and other entities. Add different tiles to the game, trees/shrubs.

   Tuesday: Work on the additional functionality, time/inventory/money. Think about having a second canvas ontop of current one for a better look.

   Wednesday: Work on the aesthetics of the game, fix anything that needs to be fixed. Maybe think about adding animation to things such as grass, water, or walking. Work on the webpage outside of the game through css.

   Thursday: Deploy project to github and rewrite the proposal README.

## Bonus Features

- Add difficulty to the game, maybe a survival mode where there is hunger and you are able to actually lose the game
- Add NPCs that the user can interact with, and maybe fall in love with.
- Add shading based on the time of day / Add seasons 
- Add music/sound effects
- Better error handling
