Background

    The game I will be attempting to make is a farming simulator similar to the popular game Stardew Valley. There really isn't a definitive objective or an end to Stardew, you are able to keep playing until you are satisfied. You gather resources through a number of different 'tasks', farming, fishing, trading, etc. Through these resources you are able to upgrade your land along with other fun uses. The game is meant to be relaxing with no real pressure to progress.

    Honeydew Valley will be similar in that you will be able to farm/fish/trade to gather resources to buy decorations for your land and/or make your life easier. The game will only feature one area, the starting area, but will have all the functionality of the whole city within this one area.

Functionality

    In this game users will be able to:
    - Move around the map using their keyboard
    - Through a simple inventory system select what they are currently "holding" and use the spacebar to use it
    - Access a shop and chest to manage your inventory
    - Farm and fish for resources to sell or consume

    In addition this project will include:
    - A side panal with controls and some general game rules
    - A production README

Techonologies, Libraries, APIS

    This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
    -Canvas API to render the game
    -Webpack to bundle and transpile the source Javascript code
    -npm to manage project dependencies

Implementation Timeline

    Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Get the basic functionality completely down, gather all the nessessary resources. Think about the different plants and fish that will need images. Refactor the code to create multiple JS files instead of everything in a single file.

    Monday: Work on the game flow, how the plants will grow, how fish will be caught, and how the interactions will work between the user and other entities. Add different tiles to the game, trees/shrubs.

    Tuesday: Work on the additional functionality, time/inventory/money. Think about having a second canvas ontop of current one for a better look.

    Wednesday: Work on the aesthetics of the game, fix anything that needs to be fixed. Maybe think about adding animation to things such as grass, water, or walking. Work on the webpage outside of the game through css.

    Thursday: Deploy project to github and rewrite the proposal README.

Bonus Features

- Add difficulty to the game, maybe a survival mode where there is hunger and you are able to actually lose the game
- Add NPCs that the user can interact with, and maybe fall in love with.
- Add shading based on the time of day / Add seasons 
- Add music/sound effects
- Better error handling
